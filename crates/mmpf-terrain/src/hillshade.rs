//! Baked vector hillshade generation from a Terrarium DEM neighborhood.
//!
//! The shading model is a discretization of maplibre-gl's default (`standard`)
//! raster hillshade: the same per-zoom slope exaggeration, the same
//! aspect-based shadow/highlight mix, `sin(atan(slope))` intensity, and the
//! slope-only accent term. To keep tiles small, the full shader composite is
//! projected onto a single signed tone value per cell — the luminance shift it
//! would cause over a reference background using the reference palette — so
//! one polygon partition carries everything: `class` is the sign (`shadow` /
//! `highlight`), `level` the perceptually quantized magnitude, and a style
//! reproduces the raster look with two fill layers and midpoint opacity ramps
//! (shadow at the reference dark color, highlight white).
